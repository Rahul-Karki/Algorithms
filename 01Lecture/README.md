Practical-1: Power of a Number
Aim

To implement and compare two methods to calculate the value of a number raised to the power n using recursion.

Theory

The optimized recursive method calculates the result by dividing the exponent into halves, which reduces the number of recursive calls.

The simple recursive method calculates the result by multiplying the base repeatedly until the exponent becomes zero.
